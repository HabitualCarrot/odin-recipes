    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p><strong>Grilled Cheese</strong>, an American classic. Whether it be from your grandmothers kitchen or a gourmet resturaunt, this simple meal is the ultimate comfort food. There are <em>many many many</em> ways of preparing this dish, but I prefer to keep it simple.</p>
        </p>
        <p>Today I will be covering my preferred method, the way my grandmother taught me. Let's dive in and see what we'll need!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p><em>choice of bread and cheese is up to your preference, but do note that thinly sliced breads may not hold up to the heat as well</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>butter</li>
            <li>white american cheese</li>
            <li>mayo</li>
            <li>sliced bread</li>
            <li><em>optional:</em>sliced oven roasted turkey</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>bring your skillet to medium/high heat</li>
            <li>butter one side of a slice of bread and place it butter side down on the skillet</li>
            <li>add your cheese (one to two slices)</li>
            <li><em>optional: add sliced oven roasted turkey</em></li>
            <li>apply mayo to one side of slice of bread and place on top (mayo side down)</li>
            <li>butter the top slice of bread</li>
            <li>cook until bottom slice is golden brown, and then flip</li>
            <li>continue until cheese is melted</li>
        </ol>
